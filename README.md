memuller's Stylish Styles Collection
====================================

My personal collection of CSSs, to be used with the Stylish browser extension.

Most of those styles remove needless site functionality, improve legibility, or enhance layout for usage on portrait-oriented, narrow displays. Some of them require additional scripts.

**Your mileage may vary.**

---------------

* **google-narrow**: greatly enhances Google search results for narrower displays, maximizing screen usage.
* **dark-google-bg**: removes background image from the Dark Fusion Google style.
* **messenger-narrow**: maximizes screen space on Facebook Messenger online app; mostly by compacting the contacts list.
* **freelancer-narrow**: enhances project listings on Freelancer.com.
* **nyaa-narrow**: enhances [Nyaatorrents](http://nyaa.eu/) search results pages for (yup, you guessed it) narrow viewports.
